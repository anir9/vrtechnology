My Unity3D and Blender projects from my Virtual Reality Technology course
It seems that the files are too big for me to upload to GitHub, so I have uploaded my lab reports in the main branch. The reports explain the requirements of my labs, how I met these expectations and the specific textures/materials and meshes I used. They also contain links to my virtual demonstrations/animations on YouTube, as well as the original project files uploaded to Google Drive.
